Minimanual: how to give Greta some gaze targets to look at in Unity.

we need targets for the other coaches, called "head_COUCH_M_1" etc.

we need other targets that we have in Unity, such as the head_COUCH_USER and BrowserGazeTarget

Such targets are defined in Greta's environment file.
This environment is defined in the file "Greta/bin/vib.ini", and by default point at Empty.xml.
Change that path to "./Environments/Projects/Council of Coaches/TechnicalDemonstrator.xml".

Greta is assumed to be in 0,0,0 location

Add targets and move them around to get the best fitting gaze target behaviour. The BML Window for Greta (in Launchers) has a dropdown with a gaze example.

Final note: if the Ogre player is not running and connected, gaze will lead to nullpointers

So the computer running Greta will show Greta and her speech using Ogre, while at the same time the computer running the COUCH-UNITY scene will show Greta as part of the Couch Office.s
