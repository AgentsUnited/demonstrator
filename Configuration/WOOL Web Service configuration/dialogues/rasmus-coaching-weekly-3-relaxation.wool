Build in about 3 moments to relax of 5-10 minutes during the day. If you are inside a lot, go outside during your relax moment.

Don't do anything at all during a relax moment, listen to music or think about a good memory.

The stomach breathing forms the basis of all relaxation exercises and yoga. Yoga can help working on your breathing.
