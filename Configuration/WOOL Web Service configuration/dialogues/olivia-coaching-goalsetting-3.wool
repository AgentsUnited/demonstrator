Currently you have $paLongTermStepsGoal steps daily as a long-term goal. However, we need to build up to that point. Should we start with a short-term goal of ($paLongTermStepsGoal-1500) steps daily as a short-term goal?

[[Okay, let's do that!|ShortTermGoalAccepted|<<set $paShortTermStepsGoal = $paLongTermStepsGoal - 1500>>]]

    That is great! So, we are working towards $paShortTermStepsGoal steps per day in the short term.

Wonderful to hear that you are willing to try a bit more! So, what about ($paLongTermStepsGoal - 1000) steps per day? Remember, we are not talking about long-term goals, but about your goal for tomorrow.

[[Yes, let's do that!|ShortTermGoalAccepted|<<set $paShortTermStepsGoal = $paLongTermStepsGoal - 1000>>]]

        Okay, what about aiming for ($paLongTermMinutesGoal - 15) minutes of moderate to high intensity physical activity per week?

        [[Yes, let's do that!|ShortTermGoalAccepted|<<set $paShortTermMinutesGoal = $paLongTermMinutesGoal - 15>>]]

    <<else>>
        Okay, what about ($paLongTermMinutesGoal - 8) minutes of moderate to high intensity physical activity per day?

Ok, then I would like to suggest a short-term goal of ($paLongTermStepsGoal-2250) steps per day. Is that ok?

        Ok, then I would like to suggest a short-term goal of ($paLongTermMinutesGoal - 45) minutes of moderate to high physical activity intensity per week. Remember that we are discussing the short-term goal, not your long-term goal. Is that ok?

Let's just start with ($paLongTermStepsGoal-3000) steps per day, and we see how it goes. If it does not work for you, we can adjust it next week.

Now that we have set a smaller and achievable short-term goal together, we can take one small step to slowly work up to to your final goal!
