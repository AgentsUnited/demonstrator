That is a great goal! You can even try to involve your dog to give them more of a workout, and make it more fun to walk. We will start working on your average daily amount of steps per week.

There are different ways to achieve that goal. You can either increase the amount of steps you take, or try to spend more time physically active. Either would be a good goal to get you started.

Steps are not just going for walks, but are measured during anything you do. Simply walking around your house to grab something in the kitchen is also counted.

And we measure your physically active time in minutes that we measured your heartbeat having increased. That happens when you put in that little bit of extra effort to do something.
