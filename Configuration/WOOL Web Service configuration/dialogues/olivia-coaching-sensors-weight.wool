Open the app and tap the button "Weight Scale".
Step into the weight scale and wait for the measurement to appear in the scale display.
The value should appear in your phone screen. It will be sent to me automatically right away.
You're done!

Go to your phone Bluetooth settings and enable discovery.
This is usually done automatically when you go to Bluetooth settings.
You should see a list of nearby devices.

You should have received a compatible weight scale from your COUCH service provider.
The best choice for a compatible weight scale is A&D Medical Bluetooth Low Energy Weight Scale UC-BLE352.
